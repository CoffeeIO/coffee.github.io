Chrome Extension for making the Trello due date reminder more customizable.

You can find the extension on the Chrome store: [Trello Enhanced Date](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello-enhanced-date/ekkepplnmefeilpjninfgmmbdadamadl)

## Usage
<h5>Days info</h5>
<p>The number of days indicates when the selected color should be used. A <b>positive number of days</b> is number of days after the deadline. A <b>negative number of days</b> (e.g. "-7") indicates number of days before the deadline.</p>
<h5>Colors info</h5>
<p>Colors are currently limited to <b>only hex colors</b>, as that's easy to write code for. The "#"(hash) character is currently required, so this will allow hex colors of 4 and 7 characters (e.g. #FFF and #FFFFFF)</p>
<p>If the is interest in support for RGB and named colors (e.g. light-blue), I'll look into implementing it.</p>
<h5>Language info</h5>
<p>Currently <b>only english is fully supported</b>. If there is interest in support for other language send a mail to <a href="mailto:mgapcdev@gmail.com" target="_top">mgapcdev@gmail.com</a> or submit an issue on the github page.</p>
