<h1>License</h1>

<h2>TypesetBot licenses</h2>
TypesetBot has two kinds of licenses relavant to different applications: open-source and commercial.

<h3>Open source license</h3>
<p>The open source license is designed for you to use TypesetBot to build open source and personal projects. The TypesetBot open source license is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3</a>. The GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important is how <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#section5">it is <em>sticky</em> when you distribute your work publicly</a>. From the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">GPL FAQ</a>:</p>

<p>
        If you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL.
</p>


<h3>Commercial license</h3>
<p>
        The commercial license is designed to for you to use TypesetBot in commercial products and applications, without the provisions of the GPLv3. With the commercial license, your code is kept propietary, to yourself. If you want to use TypesetBot to develop commercial sites, themes, projects, and applications, the commercial license is the appropriate license.
</p>

<h3>Purchasing a commercial license</h3>
<p>
        Purchasing takes a minute. Our purchasing form accepts credit cards or PayPal. Once purchased, you’ll receive a commercial license PDF and you will be all set to use TypesetBot in your commercial applications. With the purchase of a commercial license:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>You may use TypesetBot in any commercial application you like.</li>
    <li>You may use TypesetBot in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium WordPress, Tumblr, or other CMS themes, plugins and templates.</li>
